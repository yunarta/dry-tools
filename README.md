# Don't Repeat Yourself - Use this tools

Our collection of tools is designed to tackle your Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD)
challenges. Instead of entangling yourself in Bash or PowerShell scripts, you can use this meticulously compiled
arsenal for seamless integration and deployment.

## Purpose

The main objective of creating these tools is to simplify and automate the repetitive tasks associated with CI/CD
pipelines. In the quest for efficiency and reliability, we often resort to handwritten scripts that could be
prone to errors and hard to maintain. These toolsets aim to eliminate such issues, thus improving the overall
reliability and maintainability of your code.
